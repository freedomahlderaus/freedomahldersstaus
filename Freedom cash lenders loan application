Freedom cash lenders loan application

The terms for bad credit lenders may vary widely between lenders, and you should apply to no less than three different lenders and compare their rates and fees. If you have a relationship with a community bank or credit union, see if they offer any rate discounts or fee reductions for bad credit personal loans.

Online personal loan lenders may offer the most options for bad credit borrowers. Some companies use more lenient criteria than traditional banks for approval, such as your job and education history. When you’re comparing lenders, check their website or ask them for information about:

Minimum credit scores. The minimum may be as low as 500 or as high as 670, depending on the lender.
Loan amount ranges. Some lenders offer competitive options for smaller loan amounts (below $2,500). While several personal loan lenders offer loan amounts as high as $100,000, bad credit lenders tend to limit you to $50,000 or less.
Repayment terms. Bad credit loan terms usually range between one and five years. Choose a longer term for the lowest possible payment. You’ll probably be capped at five years, although some lenders may offer a longer term for a smaller loan amount.

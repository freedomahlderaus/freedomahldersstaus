Getting a personal loan with bad credit may require you to take extra steps to prove you can repay the loan. Lenders consider a low credit score a sign that youâ€™ve had trouble managing credit in the past, and they usually offset that risk by charging higher APRs, fees and offering lower loan amounts that must be paid off faster than fair or good credit loans.

Knowing what you need for approval and then shopping around and comparing offers is the best way to get a personal loan if you have a low credit score.

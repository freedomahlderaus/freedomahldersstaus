Freedom cash lenders prequalified

All you need is proof of a regular paycheck to qualify for a payday loan of up to $500. The catch is the balance — plus lender fees, which range from $10 to $30 for every $100 you borrow — must be paid back from your next paycheck.

Consumers often use these for basic needs like rent, food or utility bills. The quick repayment schedule leaves little room for the unexpected, and payday borrowers often extend or renew payday loans multiple times. Many states ban or severely restrict payday lending because of the damage it does to borrowers living paycheck to paycheck.
